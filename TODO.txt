 - PR flow
    - special club for pharmacists. hardcoded club id.
        - membership follows normal club rules (invite links etc)
        - attached discord server will be plpasscode server
    - pharmacists can edit the peer review metadata
        - should they be able to edit the other metadata (ex localised name)?
        - probably, we're already trusting them
        - they probably shouldn't be able to delete though
    - add views for PR
      - we're not reusing the pr tool
       
 - daily blend
    - probably a table with [date, level] and date is unique
    - so that you can schedule them easily
    - notifications?? how do we get the discord message out
 - add public test server in plpasscode
 - think about what we should actually put on the user's profile page for now
 - user can access a list of all their levels
 - club admins/owners can access a list of all the club's levels
 - sync to a datasette instance for continued levelsync support
    - we need to be a bit careful about not exposing private data
    - I think the safest way is to to_dict the levels (which is always safe) and
      make a totally unrelated database
 - replace placeholder image for bot avatar
    - let's commision a drawing of nicole for this
    - how do I commission art???
 - favicon
    - reuse existing one from rc1
 - delete account (what do we do about their levels?)
 - delete club (what do we do about their levels?)
 - migration plan for RDL (i.e. transition line the second)
 - make the loading screen not suck
