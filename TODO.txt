 - PR flow
    - special club for pharmacists. hardcoded club id.
        - membership follows normal club rules (invite links etc)
    - pharmacists can edit the peer review metadata
        - should they be able to edit the other metadata (ex localised name)?
        - probably, we're already trusting them
        - they probably shouldn't be able to delete though
    - special views for pharmacists? or just reuse the pr tool?

 - daily blend??
 - way to recover a deleted level
 - add public test server in plpasscode
 - think about what we should actually put on the user's profile page for now
 - user can access a list of all their levels
 - club admins/owners can access a list of all the club's levels
 - sync to a datasette instance for continued levelsync support
 - replace placeholder image for bot avatar
 - favicon
 - migration plan for RDL (i.e. transition line the second)
