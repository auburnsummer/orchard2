 - PR flow
    - beta test in back alley

 - add public test server in plpasscode

 - think about what we should actually put on the user's profile page for now
 - user can access a list of all their levels
 - club admins/owners can access a list of all the club's levels
 - sync to a datasette instance for continued levelsync support
    - we need to be a bit careful about not exposing private data
    - I think the safest way is to to_dict the levels (which is always safe) and
      make a totally unrelated database
 - replace placeholder image for bot avatar
    - let's commision a drawing of nicole for this
    - how do I commission art???
 - favicon
    - reuse existing one from rc1
 - delete account (what do we do about their levels?)
 - delete club (what do we do about their levels?)
 - migration plan for RDL (i.e. transition line the second)
 - make the loading screen not suck
